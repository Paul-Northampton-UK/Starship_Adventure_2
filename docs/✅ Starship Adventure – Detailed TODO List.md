✅ Create main.py entry point
✅ Implement YAML loader (for rooms, objects, settings)
🔄 Design central game loop and state machine
✅ Integrate spaCy for command parsing
🔄 Create alias/action translation system (e.g. n, go north, walk north)
🔄 Build modular command handler (actions, movement, examine, etc.)

🖥️ GUI & Interface

🔄 Build main game window with pygame
🔄 Add GUI components:
  - Room name header
  - Room exits footer
  - Main scrollable game output box
  - Narrator dialogue box
  - Visible objects box
  - Command input field (typed input)
  - Compass control (clickable directions)
  - Action buttons (Look, Take, Use, Inventory)
  - Toggleable side panels:
    - Inventory (weight/size shown)
    - Player stats (health, stamina, oxygen, etc.)
    - Environmental panel (oxygen, gravity, temperature)
    - Fog-of-war map panel
  - Score and move counter
  - Save / Load buttons
🔄 Implement UI theming/personalization options (future feature)

🧠 Command & Interaction System

🔄 Support typed input with NLP variations
🔄 Enable command aliases and abbreviations
🔄 Add player-to-narrator interactions (e.g. help, insult, ask, hint)
🔄 Handle invalid/gibberish commands with unique narrator responses
✅ Ensure command vocabulary is easily expandable via YAML

🎮 Gameplay Mechanics

✅ Define object structure (ID, name, description, size, weight, visibility, etc.)
🔄 Build inventory management system
🔄 Backpack system with size/weight constraints
🔄 Carried object tracking
🔄 Implement environmental mechanics:
  - Room-specific oxygen, temperature, gravity, pressure
  - Hazards (e.g. suffocation, overheating, radiation)
  - Handle death scenarios and narrator warnings
🔄 Object container logic (e.g. batteries inside torch, items inside locker)
🔄 Enable object activation, assembly, disassembly

🧩 Puzzle & Story System

🔄 Implement puzzle system with difficulty tiers (Easy, Medium, Hard)
🔄 Add support for:
  - Logic puzzles
  - Code entry terminals
  - Physical object combination puzzles
  - Environmental / time-based puzzles
🔄 Implement scoring system based on puzzle difficulty
🔄 Track puzzle completion and tie it to story progress
🔄 Embed core story across room descriptions, tablets, terminals

🤖 Narrator System

🔄 Build narrator module:
  - Contextual sarcasm and insults
  - Humorous responses to player input
  - Warnings before danger
  - Custom reactions to swearing or nonsense input
  - Narrator hint system with point penalty
  - Narrator help system for tutorial commands

💾 Save/Load System

🔄 Auto-save on game exit
🔄 Manual save/load UI with multiple player profiles
🔄 Save system must persist:
  - Inventory
  - Rooms visited
  - Player stats
  - Puzzle progress
  - Environmental states

🔊 Audio/Visual

🔄 Add loading screen splash with fade + intro music
🔄 Implement ambient music engine (per area or event)
🔄 Add basic sound effects (UI actions, interactions, alerts)
🔄 Display optional static artwork per room or cutscene

📜 Logging

🔄 Player log (all typed input + system output)
🔄 System log (functions triggered, errors, game state changes)
✅ Use loguru with rotating log files and timestamps

🧩 Expandability

✅ Game world defined via external YAML
✅ All rooms, objects, puzzles, and dialogue must be extendable
✅ YAML validation and error catching
🔄 Document expansion format (README or DevDocs)

🧹 Coding & Dev Standards

✅ Follow naming conventions:
  - snake_case for variables/functions
  - PascalCase for classes
  - ID prefixes (e.g., nav_, com_)
✅ Docstrings and inline comments throughout
✅ Error handling for all I/O and YAML parsing
✅ Clean modular codebase with reusable components

🛸 Future Features (Optional / Phase 2+)

- Multiplayer or co-op exploration mode
- Skill-based puzzles or character development
- Achievements/trophies system
- TTS narrator using ElevenLabs or equivalent
- Mod support
- Planet-side missions outside the ship
