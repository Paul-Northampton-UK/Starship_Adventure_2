  description: A high-backed command chair anchored to the deck by a magnetic stabilizer
    ring. The surface is upholstered in dark synthetic leather, worn smooth at the
    edges from long shifts and countless decisions. Integrated arm panels house faded
    control interfaces, now dormant. A small indentation at the base suggests biometric
    access, long inactive. Despite the silence, the chair still carries the weight
    of authority—it feels like it's waiting for someone to take command.

  description: A standard-issue shipboard torch, compact and rugged. Its brushed metal
    casing is scuffed from years of service, and a faint amber glow surrounds the
    standby switch. Designed for zero-G handling, the grip is textured for gloved
    fingers. A side panel on the rear unscrews to reveal the battery compartment,
    sealed tight against moisture and vacuum.

  description: The cap is a close-fitting, utilitarian piece of headgear made from
    flexible nano-fabric, its surface dull and lightly textured. A narrow visor shades
    the eyes, embedded with a faint, inactive thread of circuitry along the brim.
    The inner band is lined with soft mesh for comfort and grip. Stitched into the
    side is a worn patch—just a symbol now, the meaning currently lost on you. It's
    the kind of cap made to be worn, not admired.
