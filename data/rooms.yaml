      The bridge is shrouded in absolute darkness. No screens flicker, no consoles
      hum—just the vast,
      silent emptiness. The air feels heavier here, as if the absence of power has
      drained the room
      of its authority. Without a light source, you can barely make out the shadows
      of command stations.

    emergency: >
      Dim emergency lighting casts an eerie bluish glow along the walls, barely illuminating
      the control
      stations. Most screens remain inactive, their surfaces reflecting the weak glow
      of status indicators.
      A few panels blink warning messages, while the enormous **Bridge Viewer** looms
      dark and vacant, waiting for
      someone to bring it back to life.

    main_power: >
      The bridge comes alive with brilliant lighting and the hum of active systems.
      Data streams race across
      control stations, illuminating the walls with holographic projections. The **Captain's
      Chair** is bathed in
      command-ready light, and the main **Bridge Viewer** dominates the room, displaying
      ship diagnostics and
      navigational readouts. The heart of the ship has been restored.

    torch_light: >
      The beam of your torch sweeps across the bridge, revealing consoles locked in
      error states,  keyboards frozen in diagnostic loops, and control panels awaiting
      reactivation.  The **Captain's Chair** looms in the flickering light, a silent

        The station is completely dark. You can barely make out the outlines of consoles
        in the dim glow  of your torch—if you have one. Otherwise, you're completely
        blind. The silence is unsettling,  as if the ship has been adrift for an eternity.

      emergency: >
        The dim emergency lighting casts long shadows across the consoles. A single
        display flashes bold red:  "Warning - Ship is off course. Please enter course
        correction immediately!" The faint hum of backup  power vibrates beneath your
        feet, and the faint static of unprocessed data crackles from the speakers.  The
        station feels abandoned, waiting for someone to restore it.

      main_power: >
        The station is brightly illuminated, its displays alive with data streaming
        across the screens. The  main navigation interface projects a holographic
        star map, tracing the ship's trajectory through the void.  A low hum of energy
        fills the space, and every control panel is responsive and fully operational.

        The station is shrouded in darkness. Without power, the consoles are dead,
        and the once-vibrant  holograms have vanished. The silence feels unnatural
        in a space meant for discovery. The air  carries a faint sterile scent, as
        if the experiments and research have been frozen in time.

      emergency: >
        The Science Station is dimly illuminated by emergency lighting. Flickering
        holograms cast  eerie reflections across the metallic surfaces, and the faint
        hum of standby power resonates  through the lab. Some devices display error
        messages, awaiting the return of full functionality.

      main_power: >
        The station is fully operational, with instruments actively analyzing data.
        Screens display  molecular structures, spectral readings, and deep-space anomalies.
        A large holographic display  projects shifting graphs and particle waveforms,
        while containment chambers secure mysterious  biological samples. The air
        is alive with the pulse of scientific discovery.

      torch_light: >
        Your torch beam flickers across the workstations, illuminating dormant instruments

        making the space feel strangely isolated.

      emergency: >
        The **Communication Station** is dimly lit, with only a few status lights
        still active. The main  **Long Range Transmitter** is unresponsive, though
        backup channels intermittently display faint static.  A small **Broadcast
        Panel** blinks on one of the consoles, its message unreadable in the weak
        glow.  Occasional bursts of garbled audio play through a broken speaker, remnants
        of lost signals.

      main_power: >
        The station hums with energy as data streams across multiple **signal interface**
        monitors.  Real-time transmissions flow in bursts of scrolling text and waveform

        The station is lifeless, its screens blank. Without power, the helm is useless,

        systems makes the  vastness outside feel even more distant.

      emergency: >
        The **Helm Console** flickers dimly under emergency power. Navigation readouts
        are offline,  and **Thruster Controls** are unresponsive. A red warning indicator
        blinks:  "PRIMARY PROPULSION SYSTEMS OFFLINE. MANUAL OVERRIDE REQUIRED." The
        subtle hum beneath your  feet suggests the ship is in a barely functioning
        standby mode.

      main_power: >
        The **Helm Station** is fully operational. Screens display real-time velocity,

      A compact yet functional cabin, its smooth metallic walls dimly illuminated
      by the emergency lighting
      strips running along the ceiling edges. The air carries a faint metallic scent,
      sterile yet oddly
      comforting. A sturdy bed sits against the far wall, with a large foot **locker**
      positioned at its base.
      A small **table** beside the bed holds a blinking **tablet** and a colorful

      The moment you pry open the panel, a gust of stale, pressurized air rushes out,
      carrying the scent of
      machine oil and dust. You crawl inside, finding yourself in a narrow, claustrophobic
      **maintenance alcove** barely large enough to stand in. Pipes and conduits twist
      around the space, pulsing
      faintly as the ship's dwindling emergency power struggles to keep basic functions
      online. The entire alcove is
      shrouded in **absolute darkness**, and without a torch, you are completely blind.

    emergency: >
      You step inside the cramped **maintenance alcove**, its low ceiling forcing
      you to hunch slightly.
      Thick bundles of insulated cables snake along the walls, humming faintly as
      they distribute the ship's
      dwindling emergency power. A dust-covered **toolbox** sits wedged into the corner
      beneath a flickering
      diagnostic panel. Despite the tight space, you get the distinct feeling that
      no one has been in here

      death trap.

      As your torch beam flickers across the alcove, shadows dance eerily against

      a manual override **lever**
      is mounted beside the hatch, allowing emergency access. Without power, escape
      will require effort.
    emergency: >
      The dim emergency lighting strips along the floor cast a dull glow over the
      docking bay. The airlock

      The Captain's Yacht is firmly secured by the docking clamps, its streamlined
      hull gleaming faintly in the low
      light. A soft hiss of stabilizing gasses escapes from beneath the coupling,
      reminding you the craft can be
      launched at a moment's notice. The airlock to the yacht stands ready, the interior
      lights visible through the
      transparent hatch. 
    undocked: >
      The docking clamps lie empty, their mechanical arms retracted to the sides of
      the bay. Where the yacht once
      rested, only a few dangling cables and a faint ring of scuffed paint betray
      that it was ever here at all.
      A hollow echo underscores the absence of the Captain's Yacht, as if the bay
      itself feels the loss.
    destroyed: >
      The docking bay is a graveyard of melted steel and shattered hull fragments.
      The yacht's remains are barely
      recognizable, its once-pristine hull reduced to scorched wreckage. A faint metallic

      An empty docking cradle sits forlornly. The Yacht is nowhere to be seen.
